# Lesson 2.1 | Core Values Extraction

Surface the five non-negotiable values that anchor your decisions and motivation.

## The Foundation of Authentic Living

Your core values are the compass that guides every decision you make, whether you're aware of it or not. They're the fundamental principles that define who you are at your deepest level - the non-negotiable standards that determine what you'll fight for, what you'll walk away from, and what gives your life meaning. When you're living in alignment with your core values, you feel authentic, energized, and purposeful. When you're not, you feel disconnected, drained, and lost.

## What Are Core Values?

Core values are the fundamental beliefs and principles that guide your behavior and decision-making. They're not goals or aspirations - they're the bedrock principles that remain constant throughout your life.

### Characteristics of Core Values

**Timeless**: They don't change based on circumstances or life stages
**Universal**: They apply to all areas of your life
**Non-negotiable**: You're willing to sacrifice other things to honor them
**Motivating**: They energize you and give you direction
**Authentic**: They reflect your true self, not who you think you should be

### Core Values vs. Other Types of Values

```javascript
const valueTypes = {
  coreValues: {
    description: "Fundamental principles that define who you are",
    examples: ["Integrity", "Growth", "Connection", "Freedom"],
    characteristics: ["Timeless", "Universal", "Non-negotiable"]
  },
  aspirationalValues: {
    description: "Values you want to embody but don't yet",
    examples: ["Confidence", "Leadership", "Creativity"],
    characteristics: ["Future-oriented", "Developmental", "Goals"]
  },
  situationalValues: {
    description: "Values that matter in specific contexts",
    examples: ["Efficiency at work", "Patience with children"],
    characteristics: ["Context-dependent", "Flexible", "Practical"]
  }
};
```

## The 5-Step Core Values Extraction Process

### Step 1: Life Review and Pattern Recognition

The first step is to examine your life experiences to identify what truly matters to you.

#### The Life Review Questions

**Peak Experiences**:
- What moments in your life have felt most meaningful?
- When have you felt most alive and engaged?
- What experiences would you relive if you could?

**Challenging Times**:
- What situations have been most difficult for you?
- What have you been unwilling to compromise on?
- What have you fought for even when it was hard?

**Daily Satisfaction**:
- What activities energize you and make time fly?
- What do you look forward to most?
- What would you miss if it were taken away?

#### The Pattern Recognition Exercise

Look for recurring themes across different areas of your life:

```javascript
const lifeAreas = {
  relationships: "What patterns emerge in your connections?",
  career: "What motivates you at work?",
  health: "What drives your health choices?",
  finances: "What guides your financial decisions?",
  personalGrowth: "What learning experiences matter most?",
  recreation: "What activities bring you joy?"
};
```

### Step 2: Emotional Response Analysis

Your emotions are powerful indicators of your values. Pay attention to what makes you feel strongly.

#### Positive Emotional Triggers

**What makes you feel proud?**
- Accomplishments that give you genuine satisfaction
- Actions that make you feel good about yourself
- Moments when you feel aligned with your true self

**What makes you feel grateful?**
- People, experiences, or circumstances you appreciate
- What you would miss if it were gone
- What you want to protect and preserve

**What makes you feel inspired?**
- Stories, people, or ideas that move you
- What you want to contribute to the world
- What you believe is worth fighting for

#### Negative Emotional Triggers

**What makes you feel angry or frustrated?**
- Situations that violate your sense of what's right
- Behaviors that go against your principles
- Injustices that you can't ignore

**What makes you feel disappointed?**
- When you or others fall short of your standards
- Situations that don't align with your expectations
- Opportunities that were missed or wasted

### Step 3: Decision-Making Analysis

Examine your past decisions to understand what principles guided them.

#### The Decision Review Framework

For each significant decision in your life, ask:

1. **What was the situation?**
2. **What options did you consider?**
3. **What did you ultimately choose?**
4. **What principle or value guided that choice?**
5. **How did you feel about the decision afterward?**

#### The "Why" Ladder

For each decision, keep asking "why" until you reach a fundamental principle:

**Example**:
- Why did you choose that job? "Because it offered growth opportunities"
- Why do you value growth? "Because I want to keep learning and improving"
- Why do you want to keep learning? "Because it makes me feel alive and engaged"
- Why do you want to feel alive and engaged? "Because that's what makes life meaningful"

**Core Value Identified**: Growth/Learning

### Step 4: Future Self Visualization

Imagine your ideal future self and identify what values they embody.

#### The Future Self Exercise

**Visualize your ideal self 10 years from now**:
- What are they doing?
- How are they behaving?
- What principles do they live by?
- What matters most to them?
- How do they make decisions?

**Key Questions**:
- What would your future self be proud of?
- What would they regret not doing?
- What principles would they never compromise on?
- What would they fight for?

### Step 5: Values Clarification and Prioritization

Narrow down your values to the 5 most essential ones and rank them in order of importance.

#### The Values Clarification Process

**1. Brainstorm**: List all potential values that resonate with you
**2. Group**: Combine similar values into categories
**3. Define**: Write clear definitions for each value
**4. Test**: Ask "Is this truly non-negotiable for me?"
**5. Rank**: Order them by importance in your life

#### The Values Test

For each potential core value, ask:

- **Is this truly who I am?** (Not who I want to be)
- **Would I uphold this even if it cost me something?**
- **Does this apply to all areas of my life?**
- **Would this still matter to me in 10 years?**
- **Does this energize and motivate me?**

### Values-Based Decision Making

When facing a decision, ask:

1. **Which of my core values are relevant here?**
2. **How does each option align with my values?**
3. **Which choice best honors my most important values?**
4. **What would my values-based self choose?**

### Values Conflict Resolution

When values conflict, ask:

1. **Which value is more important in this context?**
2. **How can I honor both values?**
3. **What's the highest expression of both values?**
4. **What would I regret most if I compromised this value?**

## Your Values Extraction Action Plan

### This Week's Focus

1. **Complete the life review** using the questions above
2. **Analyze your emotional responses** to identify value indicators
3. **Review your past decisions** to understand your guiding principles
4. **Visualize your future self** and their values
5. **Begin the values clarification process**

### Next Steps

In our next lesson, "Life-Domains Assessment," we'll learn how to evaluate how well you're living your core values across the different areas of your life and identify opportunities for better alignment.

### Remember

Your core values are not something you choose - they're something you discover. They're already there, guiding your decisions and shaping your life. The work is to become aware of them and then live them more consciously and consistently.

What values will you discover about yourself today?
